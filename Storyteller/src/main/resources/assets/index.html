  storywritter is a typing-based game made for 5 players. players take alternating turns, typing only one word at a time. each player has 8 seconds for his/hers turn, and if the time runs out, the game continues skipping to a next player. if the player decides to end the sentence, he should put a punctuation mark, but doing so he can't write any other word. the goal of the game is to write the best possible story you can. the game ends when the majority of players decide the story should be finished, by starting the end-game vote. </textarea>
